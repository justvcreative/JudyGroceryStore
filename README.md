# JudyGroceryStore
A cool project to teach kids how to code.

Students learn how to add items to Judy's Inventory.

To change the store-front graphic, swap the grocerystore.png for another image that is 600x792px. If you changed the image name, make sure it's updated in the html.
To change the items graphic, replace the veggies in the inventory folder with new images. Ensure they are sized 130x112px.
